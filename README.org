  Text outlining and task management for Vim based on
  [[http://orgmode.org/][Emacs' Org-Mode]]. Forked from the great work made
  in [[https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode][the jceb repo]]. This fork is a
  layer of several updates, like the pandoc integration for document export,
  the diary/journal implementation and some updates to some of the optis,
  like another approach to the tagbar integration

  The idea for this plugin was born by listening to the
  [[http://twit.tv/floss136][Floss Weekly podcast]] introducing Emacs Org-Mode.
  Org-Mode has a lot of strong features like folding, views (sparse tree) and
  scheduling of tasks.  These are completed by hyperlinks, tags, todo states,
  priorities aso.

  vim-orgmode aims at providing the same functionality for Vim.
